      Our <i>mission</i> is to support creative expression and self-discovery
      through visual and literary arts. We leverage advocacy campaigns,
      education, communities, and digital tools for a safe environment for
      young artists to create and share.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Glow Night; font-size: 2.1rem">
      Our <i>vision</i> is a stigma-free society where everyone feels confident
      to express themselves without shame or judgement.
